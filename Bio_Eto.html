    SAMUEL ETO'O FILS SR. PRESIDENT OF SAMUEL ETO'O FOUNDATION & FOOTBALL LEGEND
    BIO CURRENT AS OF MAY 2, 2022 Heralded as one of the greatest African
    football players of all time, Samuel Eto'o is a Cameroonian professional
    footballer with a career spanning 22 years. Prior to announcing his
    retirement from his playing career in 2019, Eto'o played for 11 teams,
    participated in four World Cups and six Africa Cup of Nations, and is the
    first African footballer to have won the African Golden Ball four times. In
    2009, he was voted the 5th best player in the world, scoring a total of 453
    goals across his career and holding the record as the highest scorer for the
    Indomitable Lions of Cameroon with 56 goals. He is the second player in
    history to score in two UEFA Champions League finals and won twice with FC
    Barcelona and once with Inter Milan. Eto'o has been awarded with 18 club and
    national team trophiesâ€”including the Africa Cup of Nations in both 2000 and
    2002 and the Gold Medal at the 2000 Olympics. Using his platform to advocate
    for the rights of youth, Eto'o established The Samuel Eto'o Foundation in
    2006 to raise awareness around the issues facing the African continent.
    Operating primarily in West Africa, the Foundation prioritizes the
    protection of youth through the provision of emergency aid, education,
    healthcare, and social inclusion initiatives, equipping youth with the
    vision to imagine a brighter future for themselves and their communities.
    The Foundation includes a football academy that has produced 18 professional
    footballers, nine of them are playing in Cameroon's senior national team
    with the goalkeeper named by Fifa as the 5th best goalkeeper in the world
    and the best African goalkeeper this past two years. Eto'o recently
    graduated from Harvard University on the Business Management program and has
    now been voted as FECAFOOT President and is doing an amazing job as he was
    able to work with his team and qualify for the qatar world cup.
